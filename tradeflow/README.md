TO DO: Eliminate "id" (bigserial) since tables have trade_id, factor_id, industry_id
TO DO: Include a factor_id in the interstate_factor table to related to factor table.

# Primary tables: <span style="color:#aaa">trade, factor, industry</span>

Table naming designed for 3rd graders. [View Report Sample](../../profile/footprint/) from [Exiobase .csv output](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/year) and [US State Data](../../profile/footprint/)

**The trade_id field** in trade.csv relates 5 values (year, region1, region2, industry1, industry2) to multiple impact factors for each trade row.

**The factor_id field** represents 721 unique impacts applied to each annual trade row (for imports, exports and domestic).

**trade.amount** is in **million Euros (M EUR)**, sourced directly from the Exiobase Z matrix (inter-industry transaction flows). Environmental factor coefficients are expressed per million EUR of output.

**trade_factor.level** is in physical units — not Euros. The coefficient converts M EUR → a physical quantity whose unit varies by extension:

| Extension | Unit |
|---|---|
| air_emissions | kg |
| employment | 1000 persons |
| energy | TJ (terajoules) |
| land | km² |
| material | kt (kilotonnes) |
| water | Mm³ (million cubic metres) |

The unit for any given row is found by joining to `factor.csv` on `factor_id` and reading the `unit` column.

Trade is traditionally called flow, but the term lacks clarity when relating annual trade rows to multiple factors.

Later, the 6-character "commodity" sectors can reside in the 5-character "trade" tables, or in tables starting with "commodity".

Combing state-to-state consumption: [Exiobase plus BEA](bea) based on the [USEEIO repo](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO/tree/master/import_emission_factors)

## Processing

Set a year and country in the config.yaml file and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Get US Interstate Data (uses the same config.yaml file) - [BEA Details](bea)

```bash
python bea/main.py --bea-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Lastly, [Send CSV into SQL database](https://github.com/ModelEarth/projects/issues/30):

- trade.py: Includes Exiobase download, trade flow extraction, and trade_factor.csv generation
- trade_impact.py: Creates aggregated environmental impact summary (22 columns)
- trade_resource.py: Creates 3 specialized files (employment, resource, material analysis)
- Total processing time: ~2m 30s for 188,735 trade flows
- Well within timeout limits (20 min/script, 60 min/country, 5 hours/batch)

The main.py command generates the following CSV files for each country/tradeflow combination:
- `factor.csv` - Environmental factor definitions (721 factors)
- `industry.csv` - Industry sector mapping
- `trade.csv` - Core trade flows (trade_id, year, region1, region2, industry1, industry2, amount)
- `trade_factor.csv` - Environmental coefficients (120 Selected Factors for imports/exports)
- `trade_factor_lg.csv` - All environmental coefficients (721 factors for domestic flows)
- `trade_impact.csv` - Aggregated environmental impacts
- `trade_resource.csv` - Resource use analysis
- `trade_material.csv` - Material flow analysis
- `trade_employment.csv` - Employment impact analysis

**120 Selected Factors:** Since each trade flow row gets one row per factor, the row count scales linearly — 120 factors produces 16.6% as many rows as 721 factors (120 / 721 = 16.6%). The top 120 are selected per industry from 721 total Exiobase stressors (air emissions, employment, energy, land, material, water extensions) by ranking all stressors whose absolute S-matrix coefficient meets `min_impact_threshold` (0.001) in descending order and keeping the first `partial_factor_limit` (120). `trade_factor_lg.csv` retains all 721 factors and is generated for domestic flows where the larger file is manageable.

The bea/main.py command generates the following CSV files for US domestic flows:
- `interstate_factor.csv` — state-to-state flows with `factor_id` + `coefficient` (120 Selected Factors, same selection method as `trade_factor.csv`)
- `interstate_factor_lg.csv` — same with all 721 factors (set `use_partial_factors_interstate: false` in config.yaml)
